                <h3>Why you need to track SMS messages</h3>
                <p>
                  Everyone uses SMS messaging to communicate. Even in the era of WHATSAPP and iMessage, old fashioned
                  SMS messaging is still a service we all depend on. Most people would rather text than make a phone
                  call. If you are concerned about who your children might
                  be talking to via SMS, or you are an employer who needs to track what employees are messaging on
                  company phones, then SPYLR is the ideal and the wise choice.

                    <h4>Benefits for Parents</h4><br>
                    <p>Children generally do not communicate with voice calls. Almost all of their communication is
                      through text via SMS or instant messenger clients like Whatsapp and Facebook Messenger. If you are
                      concerned about your
                      child, it is important to monitor who they are speaking to via their phones. SPYLR can help you to
                      see every message your child sends/receives, and it can even lets you view deleted text messages.
                      Also parents
                      can setup a complete list of trigger words to protect their children. You might add swear words or
                      sexually explicit language or bullying-related keywords to the list, letting you receive an alert
                      when your
                      child receives an SMS containing those words.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <h4>Benefits for Employers
                    </h4><br>
                    <p>If you are an employer and you issue your employees with company phones, then it is important to
                      track employee SMS messages. This substantially decreases risk to your business, especially if
                      your employee is planning
                      to change jobs. Also employers can add industry-specific words to the list to be alerted to data
                      leaks. Or, employers can add personal words to the list – like sexually explicit language or
                      inappropriate words
                      – to prevent employees from using work devices for non-work conversations or a non professional
                      customer service Productivity can also take a hit — your employees may spend too much time texting
                      each other.
                      With SPYLR, tracking SMS messages is a straight forward process which can be used to gauge
                      productivity and determine appropriate use of company resources such as SMS activity on mobile
                      devices.</p>

                      not backed up on a cloud, chances are you will lose access to important SMS messages that you may
                      need to refer to
                      for future use. SPYLR allows you to have a complete back-up of all your important texts, as well

                <h3>Why you need to spy on call logs</h3>
                <p>It is important to know who your child or employees are talking to on the phone. Afterall, you want
                  to make sure your child is not engaging in risky behaviour, or that your employee is not leaking
                  important company data
                  to competitors.

                    <h4>Benefits for Parents</h4><br>
                    <p>CAre you worried about whom your children are talking with? Children of this generation are more
                      or less glued to their phones at all times. As parents, we want to protect our children, but it is
                      not always possible
                      to be with them around the clock. SPYLR allows you to find out if your child is communicating with
                      a stranger or a contact which you consider inappropriate. We also provide insight into missed or
                      deleted calls
                      that could indicate if your children are hiding who they are contacting or if they are being
                      harassed by school bullies. Thankfully, with SPYLR's spy on call logs feature, it becomes easy to
                      know the extent
                      of what is going on behind any phone call. Parents will know exactly who is calling, how many
                      times they are calling, for how long and at what times.</p>

                    <p>t’s no surprise that employees are increasingly taking personal calls while on the job. -Avoid
                      unnecessary airtime usage- As the owner of a company, you know that it's important to allow your
                      employees to have some
                      freedom with this — as long as it’s not affecting their work. With our spy on phone call logs
                      feature, you can avoid unneeded confrontation by confirming from your portal whether or not an
                      employee you suspect
                      of time wasting on the phone is actually wasting time or just making a couple calls.</p>

                    <p>We use our phones for different reasons from personal and social calls, to business and service
                      calls. And while most times we hang up and forget the details of the call, there are situations
                      when having a record
                      of a call’s details comes in handy. In more serious cases, being able to track the amount of
                      calls, the times of calls and the contact name of an individual can be useful evidence for
                      bringing up a legal case
                      against a stalker or harasser. A convenient way to access your call logs, is to back up your call
                      history using SPYLR. Where all data will be stored in your online dashboard for easy access at any

                </h3>
                <p>Where is everyone? Whether you are looking to track your children who’s out late at night, or an
                  employee making an important delivery, our hidden GPS Tracker provides the accurate location data you
                  need in real-time. SPYLR

                    <h4>Benefits for Parents</h4><br>
                    <p>One of the worst nightmares you could face as a parent is not being able to reach your child and
                      not knowing where they are. It’s even more distressing to try calling them and getting no
                      response. Our hidden GPS
                      spy tracker app was developed with this exact scenario in mind. By tracking your child’s phone
                      without them knowing, you can keep them safe. If you notice that your son or daughter is not where
                      they are supposed
                      to be and you suspect they may be in danger, you can act quickly without wasting time. You will
                      also be able to track their movements in real-time, which is especially useful if they walk,
                      cycle, or take public
                      transport to school by themselves. Our software is just what you need to reliably track your
                      child’s location so you can have the comfort of knowing that they are fine.

                    <p>If you are an employer whose employees are on the road or work outside of the office, you may
                      decide to provide them with a tablet or smartphone to make it easier for them to get their job
                      done. Our hidden GPS tracker
                      is an essential business tool for you to manage the day-to-day operations of your team and
                      business. Since you can see the current and historical locations of the devices you are tracking,
                      you can figure out
                      if employees are where they say they are or if they are wasting any time during delivery runs.</p>

                      also great for your own personal use. It is an easy way for you to let your family know where you
                      are without the
                      interruption of a phone call, text, or instant message. And if you don’t have a built-in location
                      tracker on your smartphone or tablet and it gets stolen or goes missing, our hidden GPS tracker
                      app is an effective
                      way to find your mobile device again.

                <p>Nowadays children are growing up fast. Some may hide adult apps on their phones that could
                  potentially be very harmful. Furthermore, as a company owner providing work devices to employees, you
                  will want to know if employees
                  are hiding apps they are not allowed to use (or illegal apps) due to being dangerous to the company
                  network. Being able to spy on their phone software gives you complete control over what they have
                  installed on their
                  phone. It allows you to see exactly when they install the software. You can even see the software icon
                  and version number and using this information you can determine if they are installing applications
                  they should
                  not be or are updating applications they do not have permission to use an much more with SPYLR.

                  Combining all in one Keylogger, it helps to track or log the keys stuck on the target keyboard usually
                  in a covert manner, so a user doesn`t know what his or her actions are being monitored.

                </h3>
                <p>The Internet is a fantastic tool, but without parental supervision, it can turn into a dangerous and
                  destructive place. The more connected your kids become, the higher their chances to be exposed to the
                  dangers that exist
                  online and come across the violent and inappropriate content. That`s why when it comes to kid`s
                  safety, parental control software is so crucial. Software can`t do everything, but it can make parents
                  lives much easier,
                  especially when your kids are getting older and want more independence. Choosing the software for your
                  needs, pay attention to phone keylogger, which is an integral part of sophisticated monitoring.

                      time, giving
                      you a possibility to stay in front of any troublesome situations. Also receive an alert whenever

                <p>The Internet is a fantastic tool, but without parental supervision, it can turn into a dangerous and
                  destructive place. The more connected your kids become, the higher their chances to be exposed to the
                  dangers that exist
                  online and come across the violent and inappropriate content. That`s why when it comes to kid`s
                  safety, parental control software is so crucial. Software can`t do everything, but it can make parents
                  lives much easier,
                  especially when your kids are getting older and want more independence. Choosing the software for your
                  needs, pay attention to phone keylogger, which is an integral part of sophisticated monitoring.

                  Why Renew Your Subscription?
                </h3>

                <p>This question answers itself. SPYLR prides itself on its high level of customer support, innovative
                  spy phone features and the constant need to push the boundaries of what customers expect from spy
                  phone software and its capabilities. It makes sense then to always maintain service with SPYLR and
                  renew your subscription as often as possible so that you do not miss out on any important new features
                  or updates.
                  This is all done conveniently though your online account. There is no need to get the phone physically
                  and in just a few clicks and a few minutes of your time you can have another year of SPYLR and the
                  added peace of mind that, after renewal, the software will continue to work immediately where it left
                  off so you do not need to reinstall or reconfigure anything again.

                    of
                    things they are doing on their phone. Rather than guess, you can know exactly what apps are being

                    anything

                      <p>Nowadays every child needs a smartphone to function normally in society. In some ways this is
                        good, as you’ll have peace of mind knowing you can get in touch with them whenever you need
                        to. Unfortunately, there are people out there who use these devices to target your child in ways
                        that can be harmful.
                        If you’re wondering how to know what your child is downloading, reading or discussing on their
                        phone, we have the solution. Our screenshot feature gives you a snapshot of the apps and
                        websites that your child accesses on their phone, meaning you can intervene immediately if you
                        see anything that looks malicious. With SPYLR, you will have complete confidence in the
                        knowledge that your son or daughter is using their device for the fun and educational purposes
                        that it’s intended for.</p>

                  <br>
                  <p>If you've ever wondered "What is my teenage daughter talking about on her phone late at night” “is
                    my
                    sales manager treating other sales employees and customers in a pleasing way?"</p>

                      <h4>Benefits for Parents</h4><br>
                      <p>
                        If your kids are like most other kids today, they probably own a phone. While this is fine,
                        statistics show that children are more likely to give away their personal data to strangers
                        online
                        – including their phone number. Do you really know who they are talking to?
                        With our call recording app, you can have peace of mind knowing you can listen to your child’s
                        phone conversations later if you are concerned they are in danger. Protect them from
                        potentially harmful strangers or friends who may be poor influences that could possibly lead
                        them astray. With call recording, you can ensure they are making wise decisions and acting
                        responsibly when you cannot be there.

                        information and to keep intellectual property within the company. However, it is not uncommon

                        that are made through company cell phones. Monitor who, when, how many times, and what
